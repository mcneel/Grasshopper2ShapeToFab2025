## Documentation

Finished documentation content associated with this plug-in should end up in this folder. This includes:

| File Type | Extension |
|----|----|
| Glossary entries | *.term |
| Component specifications | *.spec |
| In-depth topics | *.topic |
| Example files | *.ghz |
| Image files | *.png, *.jpg, *.gif |

To begin creating documentation content for your plug-in, run the `_G2DocsAuthoring` command in Rhino and select the root folder of your plug-in. A summary of in-progress folder paths will be displayed, and once you are happy with this list, press the `OK` button.

A valid folder setting will enable some documentation authoring tools in the Grasshopper main menu, which can be used to create and edit new content.
